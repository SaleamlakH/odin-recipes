        <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
            made from scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously
            cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna
            filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls
            for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have
            found none better anywhere. serve with a leaf green salad and
            crusty garlic bread.</p>

        <h2>Homemade Lasagn Ingredients</h2>
        <p>You'll need the following ingredients to make this Lasagna:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Meat</b>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of Meat
            (1/2 pound ground pork, 1/2 pound lean ground beef).</li>
            <li><b>Onion</b>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with
            the ground meat.</li>
            <li><b>Canned tomatoes</b>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and
                a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li><b>Fresh herbs</b>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of
                parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar</b>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity
                from the tomatoes.</li>
            <li><b>Spices and seasonings</b>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned
                with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Noodles</b>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This
                recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready
                variety to save time</li>
            <li><b>Cheese</b>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and
                Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
            <li><b>Eggs</b>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they
                act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
        </ul>

                and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent.

                the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
            <li><b>Assemble the lasagna</b>: Layer the ingredients according to the
                recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the Lasagna

            <li><b>Bake the lasagna</b>: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven

        <p><b>Step 5</b>: While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted

            noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>

        <p><b>Step 7</b>: Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a

        <p><b>Step 8</b>: Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and
