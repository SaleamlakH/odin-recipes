# odin-recipes

This website helps you to cook your favorite dish by giving lists of ingredients required and steps to follow. 

In developing this site, I have used different HTML elements to put and structure the contents, such as heading, paragraph, ordered and unordered lists element and link different files, such as anchor and image element.
